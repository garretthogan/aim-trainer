## 🌟 What is This?

Ever wanted to improve your aim without installing a massive game? This browser-based aim trainer gives you a quick, fun way to warm up your reflexes. With **cel-shaded graphics** and **realistic physics**, you'll find yourself coming back to beat your high score.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Click the link above** to launch the game in your browser
2. **Click "Click to start!"** to begin your 60-second challenge
3. **Use your mouse** to aim and look around
4. **Left-click** to fire physics-based projectiles
5. **Hit targets** to score points - aim for the bullseye!

The closer to the center you hit, and the further away the target, the **more points you earn**. Can you beat 5,000 points?
